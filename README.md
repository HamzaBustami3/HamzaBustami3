# Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hamza Bustami and I am a high-schooler that has a fancy for the performing arts, especially music and specifically Piano. I also love to play chess. I have three children, one of which is a paddle-tennis prodigy! *just kidding* 
I grew up in Saudi Arabia :saudi_arabia:. I lived there for the first thirteen years of my life but after my thirteenth birthday, I moved to Jordan	:jordan: (a little over a year ago) and have been attending The American Community School of Amman ever since.

Thank you so much! Best regards, Hamza Bustami :smile:
